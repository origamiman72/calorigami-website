A couple important things:

I. This Flask environment is set up so that any page in the templates directory
   "/templates/abc.html" can be reached via either 
      "https://calorigami.berkeley.edu/abc"
   or
      "https://calorigami.berkeley.edu/abc.html".

   The only exception is layout.html, which only contains the navbar, header
   image, and footer.

II. See /templates/TEMPLATE.html for the general structure of a page.

III. The image paths have changed from old code to flask code: 
  a. /img/abc.png -> /static/img/abc.png
  b. /uploads/6/5/4/7/6547949/def.png -> /static/uploads/def.png
     ('cause /6/5/4/7/6547949 were just unnecessarily nested folders.)
